Best path to the hilltop.

A little explanation.

I surrounded the input data by a row of z's to simplify boundary checks.
('|' or '~', both greater than 'z'+1 would have been better choices, but I
noted there were no z's onbthe outside edges.)

I then located and saved the 'E' and 'S' locations and replaced them by 'a'
and 'z'. 

For part 1, I started at the 'E' location and moved out using a FIFO to
store new locations, and updating an array of distances as I moved. The
termination condition was being at the 'E' location.

Part 2 was a copy of part 1, with the following changes:
1. Start at 'S' instead of 'E'.
2. Change the condition for adjacent squares to down 1 maximum.
3. Terminate when we found a square with 'a' in it.
