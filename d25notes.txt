Addition in balanced base 5.

Converting to decimal and adding is easy, but going back to base 5, while
not terribly difficult, requires more thought than I can handle on Christmas
eve. Fortunately, I don't have to do that if I just do the addition in
balanced base 5. First convert '-' and '=' to -1 and -2 in an array. Add 
just like in base 10 where you add starting at the right and generate a
carry if the result is more than 10. For balaanced base 5 again start at
the right-most digit, and if the result is larger than 2 you subtract 5
and generate a carry to the next larger position. Unlike base 10, you might
also get a sum less than -3 where you will need to add 5 and generate a
borrow from the next larger position. Then just proceed leftward through the
digits. Finally translate the results to the digits 0-3, '-' and '='.

There is actually a bug in my code which did not affect the result so I
didn't bother to fix it. (I had better things to do, like waiting for
Santa...) Can you find it?
