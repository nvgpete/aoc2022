Passwords from 2D and 3D maps.

The first part is straightforward.

The second part is just like the first part, except for the boundary
conditions. I spent too much time trying to figure out how to fold cubes cut
in arbitrary ways (there are quite a few variations). Finally, I just
created an array by hand to match the sides of the folded cube for the data
I had.
