Cheating at rock/paper/scissors

I originally did this by doing things like
grep -c "A X" d02.txt
for each of the 9 possible combinations and then using bc to add up the
total points. That also gave me all the information to do the second part by
just changing the coefficients repesenting the points for each combination
in the bc command.

I wrote a programatic solution later.
