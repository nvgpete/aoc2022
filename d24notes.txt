Avoiding blizzards in the valley.

A few notes.
1. In order to keep all the blizzards in a char array, I recoded them as 1,
   2, 4, and 8 and used the '&' operator to figure out what was where.
2. The blizzards will repeat after LCM(wid,hgt) minutes, in my case 600 with
   wid=120 and hgt=25. 
3. Each state is dependent only on xy position and time so much needless
   searching can be avoided by checking if you have ever been at the same
   place at the same time. In retrospect, I could have used another bit
   position in the blizzard array to store that info.
