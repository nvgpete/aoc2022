Elvish Decryption

This problem was not hard, but was made more difficult by instructions which
didn't fully describe the process and an example which did not include the
questionable case. The question is whether you remove the value from the
list in cases where you move further than the length of the list so you go
by the starting point. I assumed you didn't which didn't matter in the
example, but was wrong for the actual data. Since there wasn't anything
wrong with my code, just my assumptions, it took a long time to get it
right.
