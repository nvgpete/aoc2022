Tetris with giant rocks

I started by representing the rocks as 4x4 arrays of rock shaped characters,
but almost immediately decided it was easier to use sets of xy coordinates,
where I only needed in increment or decrement the coordinates.

I started the rocks just above the highest point so the first 4 iterations
only consider the left/right motion; at that point a loop drops and wafts
them uuntil they hit. The rest is straghtforward.

For the second part, I originally was going to loop until I found a repeat 
of the initial conditions for the wind string and the rock. However, that
never happened in the test data, and I realized that the initial flat
surface was different from the rubble that subsequent rocks dropped on. I
decided if I went 100 steps that all traces of the initial conditions would
be obliterated, and started looking for a repeat from there. Once I found a
repeat, it was a simple matter to calculate how many repeats in 1E12 and the
add the remainder back on.
